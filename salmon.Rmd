### Summary: US atlantic salmon imports from `r params$country`

Data: US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. *Aquaculture data: Aquaculture Trade - All years and all countries.* 2019. https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/aquaculture-data.aspx

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

# Clean up salmon & keep the four countries with top total imports in total for the years reported (Chile, Canada, Norway, United Kingdom)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Extra for records: how data were prepared (from raw data)

# salmon <- read_csv("us_atl_salmon_imports.csv", skip = 1) %>% 
#   pivot_longer(cols = c('1989':'2017'), 
#                names_to = "year",
#                values_to = "imported") %>% 
#   mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
#   filter(Country %in% c("Chile", "Canada", "Norway", "United Kingdom"))
# 
# write_csv(salmon, "salmon_clean.csv")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
salmon_imports <- read_csv("salmon_clean.csv")

country_data <- salmon_imports %>% 
  filter(Country == params$country)

ggplot(data = country_data, aes(x = year, y = imported)) +
  geom_line()

# Try it out! Run in Console:
# rmarkdown::render(input = "salmon.Rmd", params = list(country = "Country Name"), output_file = "output_file_name.html")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Or make a function: 
render_salmon_report = function(country) {
  rmarkdown::render(
    input = "salmon.Rmd", # What's the input file to render?
    params = list(country = country), # What are the parameters?
    output_file = paste0(country, "_report", ".html") # What should I name the output file?
  )
}

# A for loop to run them all: 

country_name <- unique(salmon_imports$Country)

for (country in country_name) {
    render_salmon_report(country)
}
```
